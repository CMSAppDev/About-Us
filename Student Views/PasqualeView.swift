        Text("My name is Pasquale, but I go by Pat. I am a sophomore in high school, and I play lacrosse for the high school program. I have played for 4 years, and I am a jv team captain/varsity floater. I am very passionate about lacrosse, as it is one of my favorite sports to play. You will find that during this half of the year, I will talk about lacrosse a lot, because I feel as though the sport needs to grow. That's just me though, sports are basically my whole life.")
       
        Text("Some other things about me that are not sport-related are that I am mostly of Italian descent, as my Grandfather was born there in the mid-60's. I am passionate about a lot of things, such as music, gaming, and meeting people. I am VERY much a people person, so don't be afraid to come up to me and say hi, I'm a nice person when I'm not angry, I promise.")
